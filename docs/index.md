title: "Data Packages Best Practices"

### Introduction
This is a test. we need an index (home) page and simple navigation for the sections that will be created with bookdown. 

All content will be served from gh-pages, at https://ediorg.github.io/data-package-best-practices/ 

You could use this for documentation of any repo. see https://mobb.github.io/documentation_test3/ for examples of more features (e.g., blogs).

- here, you are playing with menus and layout, move these to the repo for above website when you reach a working stopping point.

### Get Started



- sections we want 





### Don't Forget

- For the entire site, `title` and `subtitle` are defined in `config.yml` 
- This page (i.e. `index.md`) is the index page. Edit the `title`
- pages are in the `_posts` dir, with navigation and page metadata controlled by the top-matter
- filenames in `_posts` should follow the convention of yyyy-mm-dd-title-string.md
- Set the `baseurl` in `_config.yml` for your repo if deploying to GitHub pages (e.g, this test repo's baseurl is "documentation_test3"
